## #*Poetry & Prose*

A clean and elegant **Poetry & Prose** web app that beautifully showcases literary works. Built initially with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and later upgraded to a component-based React version.

##  Description

This project is a frontend interface for browsing and appreciating poetry and prose. It offers a minimalist design inspired by literary aesthetics, promoting readability and ease of navigation. The site was first created using vanilla web technologies and was later restructured into a React-based framework.
